# Task: Caching & Optimization

## Description
Implement comprehensive data caching and performance optimization for the Draft AI tool. This includes implementing intelligent caching mechanisms for API responses, pre-computing simulation results, optimizing database queries, and implementing performance monitoring to ensure the system scales efficiently under load.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement Redis or in-memory caching for API responses
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- [ ] Pre-compute and cache simulation results for common scenarios
- [ ] Optimize database queries and implement query result caching
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Add lazy loading and pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize frontend rendering and state management
- [ ] Implement CDN caching for static assets

## Technical Details
- Implement caching layer using Redis or similar technology
- Add cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimize simulation algorithms and cache intermediate results
- Implement database connection pooling and query optimization
- Add performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Consider implementing service worker caching for offline functionality
- Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 - Draft simulation engine must be complete
- [ ] Task 006 - Draft management system must be implemented
- [ ] Redis or caching infrastructure setup
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 40-60 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and met
- [ ] Caching strategies documented
- [ ] Deployed to staging
