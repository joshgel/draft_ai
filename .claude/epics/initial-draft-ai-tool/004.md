# Task: Monte Carlo Simulator

## Description
Develop a vectorized simulation engine using NumPy to run thousands of draft scenarios and predict optimal picks. The simulator will use the VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) engine to evaluate player values across different draft positions and simulate various draft strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vectorized Monte Carlo simulation engine implemented with NumPy
- [ ] Integration with VORP calculation engine for player valuation
- [ ] Simulation of multiple draft strategies (best available, positional need, etc.)
- [ ] Statistical analysis of draft outcomes and recommendation confidence
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time recommendations during draft
- [ ] Configurable simulation parameters (number of runs, draft scenarios)

## Technical Details
- Implementation using NumPy for vectorized operations
- Monte Carlo simulation with configurable iteration count (default: 10,000 runs)
- Integration with existing VORP calculation framework
- Draft scenario modeling including pick trades and keeper considerations
- Statistical confidence intervals for recommendations
- Code locations: src/simulation/, src/monte_carlo.py

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 - VORP Calculation Engine (required for player valuations)
- [ ] NumPy and SciPy libraries
- [ ] Player data models and scoring systems

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
